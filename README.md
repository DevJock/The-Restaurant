# ISAM-5530-Project
This is my attempt at a basic but complete website frontend and backend. The frontend is written using Angular.JS, HTML and CSS while the Backend makes use of a RESful Service courtesy of Node.JS and Express JS.
This is just an example website demonstration for educational purposes. Not intended for commercial use.
